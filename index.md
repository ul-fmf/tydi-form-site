## Project description

(Copied from the project proposal, must be edited.)

In our research we will design and implement new techniques for formal verification of mathematics that will improve the capabilities of the state-of-the-art proof assistants by making them more flexible and easily adaptable to user needs. We will also advantageously combine libraries of formalized mathematics with large databases of mathematical structures.

Formalized mathematics is mathematical knowledge presented in a form that can be processed and verified by computer programs. The most successful collections of formalized mathematics incorporate large and complex libraries of mathematical theorems and proofs. These are written by mathematicians in type theory, and verified completely by proof assistants -- programs which check correctness of all the reasoning steps.

Apart from proving theorems, mathematicians also curate large collections of mathematical structures, which are used for mathematical exploration, hypothesis testing, and discovery of new mathematical laws. Even though the collections are generated with computers, they are rarely independently verified by computers to be correct.

We shall apply mathematical formalization methods to large databases of mathematical structures, with the objective to provide high-grade assurance of their correctness, and to enable new methods of exploration and analysis. We shall incorporate the databases into proof assistants, so that they are readily available for heuristic checking of statements, automatic generation of hypotheses, and guidance of proof search.

For this purpose, we will develop domain-specific type theories that are tailored to the content and structure of mathematical data, such as type theories for graph theory, finite groups, or combinatorics. We will design and implement transformations between type theories that will allow the databases to be interfaced with proof assistants and other tools for formal reasoning.

The domain-specific type theories will have other uses in formalized mathematics as well. They can be used to express auxiliary notions of type theory, such as universe levels and induction schemata, and to give modular and reusable implementations of automated reasoning algorithms.

A second goal of the project is the development of novel type systems for programming languages with low-level real-world computational effects that exhibit asynchronous, stochastic, or even quantum-mechanical behavior. We shall adapt and extend algebraic effect systems, which have so far been used successfully to describe computational effects as a programming technique for implementation of effects within a language. The results will improve our ability to design and verify the interaction of programs with their external environments.
