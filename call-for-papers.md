Computer Science Logic (CSL) is the annual conference of the European
Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL), see
[https://www.eacsl.org/](https://www.eacsl.org/). It is an interdisciplinary
conference, spanning across both basic and application oriented research
in mathematical logic and computer science.  CSL 2021 will be held as a
**virtual meeting** on January 25-28, 2021.

### Submission guidelines:

Submitted papers must be in English and must provide sufficient detail
to allow the Programme Committee to assess the merits of the paper. Full
proofs may appear in a clearly marked technical appendix which will be
read at the reviewers' discretion. Authors are strongly encouraged to
include a well written introduction which is directed at all members of
the PC.

The CSL 2021 conference proceedings will be published in Leibniz
International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs), see
[https://submission.dagstuhl.de/documentation/authors](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/documentation/authors).
Authors are invited to submit contributed papers of no more than 15 pages in LIPIcs
style (not including references), presenting unpublished work fitting
the scope of the conference.

Papers may not be submitted concurrently to another conference with
refereed proceedings. The PC chairs should be informed of closely
related work submitted to a conference or a journal.

Papers authored or co-authored by members of the PC are not allowed.

At least one of the authors of each accepted paper is expected to attend
the conference in person to present their papers.
