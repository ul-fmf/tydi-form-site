## Andrej Bauer (principal investigator)

Andrej Bauer is a professor of computational mathematics at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana. His work spans foundations of mathematics, constructive and computable mathematics, type theory, homotopy type theory, and mathematical principles of programming languages. He is an author of the book “Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics” and the initiator of the HoTT library, an extensive formalization of homotopy type theory in the Coq proof assistant. He is also known for his seminal work with Matija Pretnar on programming with algebraic effects and handlers.

## Matija Pretnar (researcher)

Matija Pretnar is an assistant professor of computational mathematics at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana. His research focuses on formalization, implementation, and semantics of programming languages. He is an expert on programming with computational effects, best known as the inventor (with [Gordon Plotkin](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/gordon-plotkin)) of algebraic effect handlers.

## Danel Ahman (postdoctoral researcher)

Danel Ahman is a postdoctoral researcher and a teaching assistant at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana. His research focuses on programming language theory, and in particular topics in dependent and refinement types, the theory of computational effects, including categorical semantics, and the use of these for writing verified software.
