## Andrej Bauer (principal investigator)

Andrej Bauer is a professor of computational mathematics at the Faculty of mathematics and Physics, Universtity of Ljubljana. His work spans foundations of mathematics, constructive and computable mathematics, type theory, homotopy type theory, and mathematical principles of programming languages. He is an author of the book “Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics” and the initiator of the HoTT library, an extensive formalization of homotopy type theory in the Coq proof assistant. He is also known for his seminal work with Matija Pretnar on programming with algebraic effects and handlers.

## Matija Pretnar (senior researcher)

Matija Pretnar is an assistant professor of computational mathematics at the Faculty of mathematics and Physics, Universtity of Ljubljana. His research focuses on formalization, implementation, and semantics of programming languages. He is a world-expert on programming with computational effects, best known as the inventor (with [Gordon Plotkin](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/gordon-plotkin) of algebraic effect handlers.

## Katja Berčič (postdoctoral researcher)

Katja Berčič is a postdoctoral researcher and a teaching assistant at the Faculty of mathematics and Physics, Universtity of Ljubljana. While working on her PhD in mathematics, she became interested in improving methods for working with mathematical data. She continued her work on the topic at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and at the Research Group of the Professorship for Knowledge Representation and Processing at FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg (KWARC). Her main research interests include knowledge representation and management, particularly for mathematics.
