# Resources

The project members participate in the development and curation of the following freely available software,
formalization libraries, and databases of mathematical structures.

## Type theory and formalized mathematics

## Programming languages

### Eff

Eff is the first programming language with first-class algebraic effect and handlers, created by Andrej Bauer and Matija Pretnar. It has inspired the development of similar langauges and incorporation of algebraifc effects and handlers into other languages and libraries.

### Æff

Æff is an experimental programming language for programming with *asynchronous* algebraic effects. It was developed by Danel Ahman and Matija Pretnar.

### Coop

Coop is a prototype programming language for programming with runners, also known as comodels. It supports modular and extensible management of computational resources, with strong guarantee of proper finalization. It was developed by Danel Ahman and Andrej Bauer.

### Millet

Millet is an experimental pure ML-like language with simple and modular codebase, intended as a template for experimentation and implementation with new programming language features. It was developed by Matija Pretnar.

## Databases of mathematical structures

### Discrete Zoo

A central repository of discrete objects with a website front-end and extensions for software packages like Sage. The DiscreteZOO project is the predecessor of MathDataHub.

### MathDataHub

MathDataHub started within the successful European Research Infrastructure project [OpenDreamKit](https://opendreamkit.org/). It provides dataset hosting and a searchable interface for the hosted datasets. It is part of MathHub, a portal for active mathematical documents and an archive for flexiformal mathematics. It is developed at the Research Group of the Professorship for Knowledge Representation and Processing at FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg (department of Computer Science), also known as KWARC, with collaborators from the Department of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Ljubljana. People currently involved are Katja Berčič, Michael Kohlhase, Florian Rabe, and Tom Wiesing.

### Catalogoue of Mathematical Datasets

A curated list of collections of databases of mathematical structures.
