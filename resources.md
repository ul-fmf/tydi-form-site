## Databases of mathematical structures

### Discrete Zoo

A central repository of discrete objects with a website front-end and extensions for software packages like Sage. The DiscreteZOO project is the predecessor of MathDataHub.

* Repository website: https://discretezoo.xyz
* GitHub: https://github.com/DiscreteZOO

### MathDataHub

MathDataHub started within the successful European Research Infrastructure project [OpenDreamKit](https://opendreamkit.org/). It provides dataset hosting and a searchable interface for the hosted datasets. It is part of MathHub, a portal for active mathematical documents and an archive for flexiformal mathematics. It is developed at the Research Group of the Professorship for Knowledge Representation and Processing at FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg (department of Computer Science), also known as KWARC, with collaborators from the Department of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Ljubljana. People currently involved are Katja Berčič, Michael Kohlhase, Florian Rabe, and Tom Wiesing.
